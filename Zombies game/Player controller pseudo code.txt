        factor in the WASD movement by getting the X and Y axis
        facotr in the mouse movement by getting the mouse axis X and the mouse axis Y
        aim = aim + mouse movement
        keep the aim located within the screen using the variables maxaim and minaim

    function with all the player animations
    {
		if the player moves on the x axis, this plays the animation for the player movement
        if the player moves on the y axis, this plays the animation for the player movement 
        this creates a variable to store the magnitude of movement
        plays animation for crosshair movement on the x axis
        plays animation for crosshair movement on the y axis
        records the magnitude of the crosshair movement
        plays the animation if the player presses the fire button on the mouse

    }

    function which makes the player actualy move
    {
        make the rigid body of the player move by using the transform position function
    }

    =function which enables shooting
    {
        put the crosshair where the mouse is in terms of aim and therefore the player shoots
        

        if player presses the left  mouse button:
        {
            crosshair moves to the mouse position and plays the selected animation

        }


    }
