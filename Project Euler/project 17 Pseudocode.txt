create a dictionary based on the indexes being numbers to 20 and common 10's after that (10, 20, 30, 100, 200, 1000...)
create a variable with the overall tally of characters found 

for n in range(1,1000):
	make string of x
	if the string length is == 1:
		// the number only has one digit
		set a variable to the characters in this number using the help of a dictionary
	
	elif the length of x == 2:
		set variables which contain the first and the second digit of the number
		if n < 20:
			// n is one of the numbers between 10 and 20 in the dictionary
			set variable to contain the number of characters of n by directly referring to the dictionary
		else:
			if second digit of n == 0:
				// the number is a multiple of ten which is less than 100
				set variable t contain the number of characters of n by directly referring to the dictionary 
			else:
				// n is one of the numbers between 19 and 100 which does not end in 0
				set variable to add 0 to the first digit of n to find the number of tens in the dictionary 
				set another variable to be the sum of the number of characters found in the tens column and the number of characters found in the units column by directly referring to the dictionary
	
	elif the string length of n == 3:
		make variables for the 3 digits separately
		make a variable for second digit + 0 ... call this x1a
		make a variable for the second digit + the third digit ... call this x1aa
		
		// here we start the statements which find the character depending on what the number could be
		// we start with the easier combinations which end in 1, 10 and 100s
		
		if the first digit = 1 and the second digit == 0 and the third digit == 0:
			// we have found the number to be 100
			set variable to the number of characters by referring to the dictionary for the number "one" and "hundred"
			
		elif the second digit == 0 and the third digit == 0:
			// we know that we are dealing with a "hundreds" number such as 200, 300 etc
			set variable to the characters of first digit (refer to the dictionary) + "hundred"
		
		elif the second digit == 0 and the third digit != 0:
			// we know that we are dealing with a number such as 101, 102, 405, 609 etc
			set variable to the character of the first digit ( use the dictionary) + "hundred" + the characters in the third digit (use the dictionary) + 3 (for the "and" in between)
		
		elif the second digit != 0 and the third digit == 0:
			// we know that we are dealing with a number such as 110, 260, 490, 370 etc
			set the variable to the character of the first digit(use the dictionary) + "hundred" + x1a (use the dictionary) + 3
		
		elif the second digit == 1 and the third digit != 0:
			// we know that we are dealing with teen numbers such as 119, 217, 316 etc
			set variable to the characters in the first digit(use the dictionary) + "hundred" + x1aa(use the dictionary) + 3
		
		else:
			// here we consider all other numbers where neither the second and the third digit == 0
			// these are numbers such as 342, 873, 289, 732 etc
			set the variable to the characters in the first digit()use the dictionary + "hundred" + x1a(use the dicitonary) + the characters in the third digit(use the dictionary) + 3
	
	else:
		// therefore the number left over has to be 1000
		set the variable to the digits in 1(refer to the dictionary) + the digits in 1000(refer to the dicitonary)
	
	tally == tally + variable(which we have been appending in every step with characters)
	
print("The total number of characters between 1 and 1000 = %s" $ tally)
